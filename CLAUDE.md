# Coding Style

Write code optimising for human readability. Always follow the Maintainability Rules below.

## Maintainability Rules

Functions should
  - Be 15 lines max
  - Have a single purpose clearly reflected in its name
  - Have no more than one level of branching. Extract another function if more is needed.
  - Follow the Single Level of Abstraction principle and read like a table of contents of operations delegating to other functions.
 
Files should have
  - No more than 100 lines of code
  - Have at most one class
 
Directories should
  - Follow a Single Responsibility principle
  - Contain related files
  - Aim to have at most seven files per directory

Favour a combination of object-oriented combined with functional programming styles
  - Use pure functions, higher order functions where possible 
  - Favour forEach or map functions over loops
  - Avoid using state unless necessary to clearly express the intent of a class
  - Use Classes with static methods (except when state is needed)
  - This allows function calls to be prefixed with the class name (e.g., `FileScanner.find_mp4_files()`)
  - This makes it immediately clear which file a function belongs to when reading code

Error logging
  - Ensure that logging is only done on the top level, eg index.ts files
    - and that the remaining code returns Outcome objects that are then logged on the top level.
  - Outcome objects could have either success or failure states, which can include errors 

Basic formatting
  - Always put a new line at the end of each file you generate
